Math/Polyhedra version 0.7
==========================

This module calculates and structures the coordinates of a library of
commonly useful regular polyhedra.  These geometrical figures can be
selected by name, or by the number of sides.

The heart of the data is a set of 62 coordinates, from which each of
these common polyhedra can be defined.  Each of the vertices can be
defined as a set of points around the origin measured with various
multiples and powers of I<phi>, also known as the S<Golden Ratio>, which
is approximately 1.618.

This package was inspired by the nice reference page provided by Robert
W. Gray: http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/Lynn/Coordinates/coord01.html
Other sites also explore the S<Golden Ratio> and these polyhedra.
